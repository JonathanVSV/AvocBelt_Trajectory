# AvocBelt_Trajectory

This repo contains two R scripts related to the article: Solórzano, J. V., Mas, J. F., Ramírez-Mejía, D., & Gallardo-Cruz, J. A. (2025). Long-Term Trajectory Analysis of Avocado Orchards in the Avocado Belt, Mexico. Land, 14(9), 1792. [https://doi.org/10.3390/land14091792](https://doi.org/10.3390/land14091792). 

## Scripts folder
1) Avocado_duration. Calculates the mean duration of the class of interest (avocado orchards) in the pixels that showed alternation. This analysis is mainly used to evaluate mapping quality and to gain deeper insights into the alternation processes.
2) Plots_n_maps. Performs all the maps used in the article. This code makes specific modifications to the default plots obtained with the [timeseriesTrajectories](https://github.com/bilintoh/timeseriesTrajectories) package.
